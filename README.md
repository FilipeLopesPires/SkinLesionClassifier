## Description 

This project aims to propose a form dealing with the classification of skin lesions into 3 unique diagnoses (melanoma, nevus, and seborrheic keratosis) based on deep neural networks working
together.
The purpose of the system developed was based on the [ISIC Challenge of 2017](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/) and uses the skin lesions datasets available online.

The validation score for the Melanoma Classifier was 0.80 and for the Seborrheic Keratosis Classifier was 0.75.
The system developed achieved a lower average accuracy score due to the combination process of the two classifiers.

## Repository Structure
